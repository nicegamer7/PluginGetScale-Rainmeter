# PluginGetScale-Rainmeter
whipped up my first Rainmeter plugin, so it will definitely have issues, like for sure.

returns the scaling factor, e.g. 138% will return 1.38 (cool eh?). it also disables Windows' scaling.

side note (or bottom as were): I have no clue if anyone other than I, can build this. that will be all.
second side note: mad props to [@farshidtz](https://github.com/farshidtz) for the logic
