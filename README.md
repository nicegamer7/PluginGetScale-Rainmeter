# PluginGetScale-Rainmeter
whipped up my first rainmeter plugin, so it will definatly have issues, like for sure.

returns the scaling factor. e.g. 138% will return 1.38 (cool eh?)

side note (or bottom as were): I have no clue if anyone other than I, can build this. that will be all.
second side note: mad props to [@farshidtz](https://github.com/farshidtz) for the logic
